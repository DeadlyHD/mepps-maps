# Mepps Maps # 

## About ##
Mepps Maps is a store locator plugin for Wordpress. Add as many locations as you want. Mepps Maps takes a client location and maps out the nearest locations. 
You can also add store info and filter by type of store. Since it saves coords in geojson format, Google Maps API doesn't have to repeatedly geocode each store address
which will help save costs on API calls for businesses with a high amount of locations or a high volume of site users. 

## Installation ##
Just upload the zip file via the plugins page on Wordpress. That's it!
